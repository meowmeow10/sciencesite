    <button type="button" onclick="window.location.href='index.html'">Home</button>
    <p>Glucose is made by photosynthesis. It is made by the leaves, and stored as starch in the roots. Glucose can be turned into many things, including making ammino acids. </p>

    <h2>Oils and Fats</h2>

    <p>Glucose can be turned into <b>Lipids.</b> Lipids are fats and oils. Lipids are stored in seeds. Seeds can also store starch.</p>

    <h2>Protein Synthesis</h2>

    <p>Glucose can be combined with Nitrates and make ammio acids, and the ammino acids are then turned into proteins. The proteins are then used to make and repair cells.  </p>
