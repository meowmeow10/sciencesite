  <h2>Kinetic Energy</h2>
  <p>The amount of Kinetic energy is dependant on the speed of the object</p>
  <h2>Gravitational potential energy store</h2>
  <p>The box has more grabitation potential energy when placed higher on a shelf. The amouut of Gravitational potential energy is dependant on the height of an object.</p>
  <h2>Thermal Energy</h2>
  <p>Thermal energy is higher the heat, and lower the colder.</p>
  <h2>Chemical Energy</h2>
  <p>Batterys, food and fuels store their energy in chemical energy stores. Petrol has a high energy store. </p>
  <h2>Elastic potential energy </h2>
  <p>A streched or squashed object has more potential energy</p>
